In a desire to learn how to make systems work better for people, I completed my Masters of Social Work at DU. During my grad program, I interned at The Civic Canopy and I found that daily at the Canopy I had the opportunity to work toward my goal of improving systems by creating the conditions where people who are most affected- and often marginalized- have a voice about the decisions being made that will affect them. So, I found a way to force the Canopy team to let me stay after my internship- let's just say my plan worked ;)",

In addition, I have a strong sense for organizational design, strategy, training and organizational learning which aligns well with my other interests.

I’ve also worked with Mile High United Way, Convio, Inc., American Humane and the City of Boulder Public Library. I hold a B.A. in Human Conflict Studies from UC Santa Barbara, as well as a Masters in Sociology from CU Boulder and a Master of Nonprofit Management from Regis University. I almost became a Master Composter.",
